{{readme}}

## Docs

Documentation for this crate can be found on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/gpapi/).

## Todo

This inludes some subset, but not all, of the Google Play API library. Some of the functionality  is missing, such as browsing and searching for packages.

## Credits

This library was originally created by David Weinstein, and is currently maintained by Bill Budington.

It follows some of the conventions set by Aurora's [gplayapi java library](https://gitlab.com/AuroraOSS/gplayapi/).  It was originally modeled after the [googleplay-api for python](https://github.com/NoMore200/googleplay-api.git) patterns.
